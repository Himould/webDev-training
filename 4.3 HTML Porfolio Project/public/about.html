<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a lovely and a gentle man, a father and husband</p>

<p>A graduate of Civil Engineering with over 6years experience, but over time, i have been wanting to go into the tech world, doing FORTRAN back then in school
  goot me really thinking that coding is not for me, but i was wrong but with the help of this bootcamp i am beginning to fall inlove with coding, and I hope to get better daily, that is the goal
</p>

<p>I am passionate and open to learning new things, and one of my aspiration is to travel the world with my family,
   I believe working as a software engineer will give me that chance...I can't wait
